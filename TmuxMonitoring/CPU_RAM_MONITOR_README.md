## üîß Usage Tips

### 1. Start with Simple Monitor
If you're new to these tools, start with the Simple CPU & RAM Monitor. It's the easiest to understand and provides all the essential information.

### 2. Use Trading Bot Monitor for Bot Management
When you need to see which trading bots are using which CPU cores, use the Trading Bot CPU Monitor. It automatically identifies your trading bots and shows their CPU distribution.

### 3. Check Trends
The Trading Bot Monitor shows CPU trends (rising/falling/stable) which helps you identify bots that are becoming more or less CPU-intensive over time.

### 4. Monitor Memory Usage
All monitors show both percentage and actual memory usage. Watch for bots using more than 1GB of RAM as this might indicate memory leaks.

### 5. Use System Analyzer for Health Checks
Run the System Analyzer periodically to get a comprehensive health report of your entire system.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If No Processes Show Up:
- Make sure your trading bots are running
- Check that the bot configuration files exist
- The monitors automatically detect Python processes

### If CPU Usage Seems High:
- Check the per-core display to see if specific cores are overloaded
- Look at the trend indicators to see if usage is increasing
- Use the System Analyzer for detailed recommendations

### If Memory Usage is High:
- Look for processes using more than 1GB of RAM
- Check the memory breakdown in the system overview
- Consider restarting high-memory processes

## üìÅ File Locations

All monitor scripts are located in:
```
/Users/apple/Desktop/lab_code/TmuxMonitoring/
```

## üîÑ Auto-Refresh

All monitors automatically refresh every 2-3 seconds to show real-time data. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop any monitor and return to the launcher.

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Run the launcher first** - It's the easiest way to access all monitors
2. **Use Simple Monitor for daily checks** - It's clean and easy to read
3. **Use Trading Bot Monitor when managing bots** - It shows bot-specific information
4. **Check trends regularly** - Rising CPU trends might indicate issues
5. **Monitor memory usage** - Watch for memory leaks in long-running bots
